## Methods

### Problem Transformation with Dubbed Copy
### Binary Relevance: One classifier for each class label
### Dimensionality reduction (SVD)


## Proposal structure

### Goal/Objective - EUROVOC multi-label classification

* Dataset summary: Data structure, Possible problems
* The problem we chose: EUROVOC + motivation

### Preprocessing

1. Parse html - using what tool? (beautifulsoup)
2. Extract features
3. Extract text
4. Preprocessing on text - using what tool? (scikit-learn)
5. Load everthing into a database (for ex. SQLite) -> Motivation: dataset doesn't fit into memory

### Baseline models

Problem Transformation:
These are methods which transforms multi-label data in a way so that existing classification algorithms can be applied on them.

* Problem Transformation with dubbed copy-weight: Given an instance with multilabels, it is replaced with as many instances as the number of labels assigned to it, each of them has a weight equal to (1/total number of labels assigned to the instance)
* Binary Relevance: Creates for each distinct label a dataset containing with all the instaces inside, then the instanes are labeled as either belonging or not belonging to this label. Then for each of the data sets a binary classifier is trained. When a new instance arrives, its classified by all binary classifiers and the output is the unoin of all labels it was marked belonging to.
* Dimensionality reduction (SVD): Builds a NxM martrix represnting the instances and the labels, then by means of matrix decomposition we can represent the data set with a matrix with a lower rank that is said to approximate the original matrix. To do this we select the top k representative features from the decomposed matrices.

Classifaction:
* Use classic supervised learning learners (ex. Decision trees, Naive Bayes, SVMs) provided by scikit-learn for multilabel classifications.

### Evaluation

* Link to multilabel classifcation survey - have to be provided by scikit-learn
